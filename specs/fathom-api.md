# Fathom API Integration

Now update the "Hello World" implementation with an integration with the Fathom API:
https://developers.fathom.ai/api-overview

Review the Fathom Claude Tool implementation here as a pattern for the MCP server API and implementation:

https://github.com/Elevated-Agents/claude-tools/blob/main/src/tools/fathom/fathom.ts

Do not implement the full API just implement the tools that are in the example implementation which includes: list meetings, get summary and get transcript.
